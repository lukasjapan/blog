Welcome to my blog.

I am a german Full Stack Software Engineer currently working and living in Tokyo.
My preferred languages are Kotlin, Ruby, C++, and PHP.
And Japanese of course.

My skills cover the whole web development stack and much more.
I care a lot about highly maintainable and scalable code, enjoying myself the most in an open source and Linux driven environment.

In this blog, you will find an interesting mix of things that I work and hack on.
