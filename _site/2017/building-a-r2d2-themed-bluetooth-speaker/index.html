        <p>My girlfriend brought <a href="https://www.google.co.jp/search?q=r2d2+popcorn+bucket&amp;tbm=isch">a R2D2 shaped popcorn bucket</a> from Tokyo Disneyland the other day.
Turns out that it’s pretty much useless, once the popcorn is gone… so I took my freedom to build something out of it.
And all I needed were some tools and a Raspberry Pi 3.</p>

<p>I proudly present my R2D2 Bluetooth Speaker!</p>

<p><img src="/images/building-a-r2d2-bluetooth-speaker/r2d21.png" alt="The finished R2D2 Speaker!" /></p>

<p>So how to build this thing?</p>

<p>The most important parts for building a speaker is the speaker unit itself and of course an amplifier.
Luckily everything can be bought on the internet nowadays.
I got a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B009V58142/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">10cm full range speaker unit</a> from Amazon (~15$).
And also the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B00K67WI9I/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">amp</a> that was even cheaper (~4$).</p>

<p>Lets have a look at the schematics:</p>

<p><img src="/images/building-a-r2d2-bluetooth-speaker/circuit.png" alt="R2D2s circuit" /></p>

<p>There is not much to explain here, its basically just soldering the parts and a few connectors together.
Since the amp runs on 12V I needed to add a converter that steps down the input voltage for the Raspberry Pi which runs on 5V.</p>

<p>First of all, I gave R2D2 a surgery:</p>

<p><img src="/images/building-a-r2d2-bluetooth-speaker/r2d2_1.png" alt="R2D2 before the surgery ..." />
<img src="/images/building-a-r2d2-bluetooth-speaker/r2d2_2.png" alt="... and after the surgery" /></p>

<p>To connect the speaker unit with the bucket I got a block of balsa wood.
Balsa is super easy to process.
As you can see in the pictures below, I attached the speaker unit to the balsa and afterwards the whole thing to the bucket.
I used some sharp screws that easily go through the plastic.
Finally I filled the gaps with a glue gun.
This is needed to prevent an acoustic short circuit.</p>

<p><img src="/images/building-a-r2d2-bluetooth-speaker/r2d2_3.png" alt="The block of balsa wood and some tools" />
<img src="/images/building-a-r2d2-bluetooth-speaker/r2d2_5.png" alt="After preparation the speaker unit is ready to be mounted" />
<img src="/images/building-a-r2d2-bluetooth-speaker/r2d2_6.png" alt="Connecting the speaker unit from the inside" /></p>

<p>I couldn’t wait, so I hooked up the amp with the speaker and my phone.
Works great so far!</p>

<p><img src="/images/building-a-r2d2-bluetooth-speaker/r2d2_12.png" alt="Testing the speaker unit" /></p>

<p>Open cables are not cool, so I have to tidy things up.
I started with the power cables.
The DC connector goes underneath R2D2.</p>

<p><img src="/images/building-a-r2d2-bluetooth-speaker/r2d2_7.png" alt="This little guy..." />
<img src="/images/building-a-r2d2-bluetooth-speaker/r2d2_9.png" alt="... can now be used to connect a 12V power source to R2D2" />
<img src="/images/building-a-r2d2-bluetooth-speaker/r2d2_8.png" alt="It is fixed with the glue gun on the inside" /></p>

<p>For a bit more comfort, R2D2 also gets a power switch.</p>

<p><img src="/images/building-a-r2d2-bluetooth-speaker/r2d2_11.png" alt="It is placed right under the speaker unit at the outside ..." />
<img src="/images/building-a-r2d2-bluetooth-speaker/r2d2_10.png" alt="... and looks like this from the inside" /></p>

<p>Next, I want to put the amp inside R2D2.
I mounted it on a prepared piece of plywood that will cover the bucket.
The DCDC converter is quite bulky and I want to hide it as well, so I also screwed it underneath the plate.</p>

<p><img src="/images/building-a-r2d2-bluetooth-speaker/r2d2_14.png" alt="The wooden plate with the DCDC converter and amp underneath ..." />
<img src="/images/building-a-r2d2-bluetooth-speaker/r2d2_15.png" alt="... covers R2D2s body and hides the inner parts" /></p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi will be mounted on the top of the plate.
It is R2D2s brain!
Once mounted, I just have to connect it to the 5V power source and the headphone jack with the amplifier.</p>

<p><img src="/images/building-a-r2d2-bluetooth-speaker/r2d2_16.png" alt="R2D2 now has a brain!" />
<img src="/images/building-a-r2d2-bluetooth-speaker/r2d2_17.png" alt="The remaining gaps have been sealed off with tape" /></p>

<p>The last task is to make the Raspberry Pi accept Bluetooth connections and output the music to the headphone jack.
By using <a href="https://github.com/lukasjapan/bt-speaker">bt-speaker</a>, a library that I wrote for this project, it can be done with a single command.
I wrote a rather technical article about how it works <a href="/2017/creating-a-blootooth-speaker-with-raspberrypi-3/">here</a>.</p>

<p>R2D2 is powered by 12V direct current.
Luckily this is pretty common for small home electronics and I had an unused power adapter lying around.
For outdoor parties I also bought him a battery.
The battery lasts for around 10h at a pretty crazy volume.</p>

<p><img src="/images/building-a-r2d2-bluetooth-speaker/r2d2_18.png" alt="R2D2 and his power sources" /></p>

<p>As a gimmick, I also added some beeps when a device connects or disconnects from R2D2.
Pretty cool.</p>

<p>OK thats it!
I hope you had fun reading this article and start building your own R2D2 now!</p>
